Experienced Software Engineer with almost 10 years in designing, building, and scaling backend systems. Currently contributing to the candidate experience at [SmartRecruiters](https://www.smartrecruiters.com), with a strong focus on distributed systems, cloud architecture, and platform reliability.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Tirana and continuously invest in deepening my knowledge of systems design, modern infrastructure, and software craftsmanship.

In addition to technology, I have a keen interest in history, communication skills, and personal development.
